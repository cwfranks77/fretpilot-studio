## 🎯 Your Tester Signup Link

**Format:**
```
https://fretpilotstudio.com/?tester_signup=fretpilot-beta-2025-tester-access-secure-token-xyz789
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before sharing, update the token in `src/services/featureFlags.js`:
1. Open `src/services/featureFlags.js`
2. Find `TESTER_SIGNUP_TOKEN`
3. Replace with a secure random string (at least 32 characters)
4. Use that same token in your signup link

**Example secure token generator:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console to generate a secure token:
btoa(Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15) + Date.now().toString(36))
```

**Or use this format:**
```
fretpilot-beta-[YEAR]-[RANDOM-STRING]-[DATE]
Example: fretpilot-beta-2025-a7f3k9m2p5q8w1x4z6-20250101
```

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **Replace https://fretpilotstudio.com/?tester_signup=fretpilot-beta-2025-tester-access-secure-token-xyz789** with your actual tester signup URL
   - Format: `https://fretpilotstudio.com/?tester_signup=fretpilot-beta-2025-tester-access-secure-token-xyz789`
   - You can create a shorter link using bit.ly or similar

2. **Update the token** in `src/services/featureFlags.js` to a secure random string before sharing

3. **Track signups** - You can check localStorage in browser dev tools to see who signed up

4. **Customize** - Feel free to adjust the tone and details to match your style!

## 🎯 Quick Link Generator

To get your tester link, check the browser console after loading the app:
```javascript
// In browser console:
import { getTesterSignupUrl } from './src/services/featureFlags.js'
console.log(getTesterSignupUrl())
```

Or manually construct:
```
https://yourdomain.com/?tester_signup=YOUR_SECURE_TOKEN
```

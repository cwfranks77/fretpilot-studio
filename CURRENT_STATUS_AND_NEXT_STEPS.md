### ⚠️ **DECISION NEEDED:**

You mentioned: *"i dont remember if we are just selling instruments now or what we decided"*

**From the code, it appears The Franks Standard was planned to be:**

1. **A gear store** selling:
   - Premium guitars
   - Pro audio equipment
   - Musician accessories
   - Instruments matched to skill milestones

2. **But it's not fully set up yet** - the site says:
   - "Hand-picked instruments & accessories matched to skill milestones"
   - "Coming soon as we finalize vendor onboarding"

### Options for The Franks Standard:

**Option A: Set up as a gear store**
- Set up e-commerce (Stripe payments)
- Add product listings
- Configure vendor/affiliate partnerships
- Create product pages

**Option B: Keep as a brand landing page**
- Just showcase FretPilot Studio
- Remove/store the "Curated Gear" section
- Focus on software products

**Option C: Hybrid approach**
- Keep gear store as "coming soon"
- Focus on FretPilot Studio for now
- Add gear store later when ready

### What You Should Decide:
1. **Do you want to sell instruments/gear through The Franks Standard?**
2. **Do you have vendor/supplier relationships set up?**
3. **Or should we just focus on FretPilot Studio for now?**

# 🎸 FretPilot Studio - December 2025 Facebook Tester Recruitment

## Why This Post is Different

The previous posts were good but may have felt too "marketing-y". This updated approach:
- **More personal/authentic** - sounds like a real person asking for help
- **Specific ask** - exactly what testers need to do
- **Lower barrier** - emphasizes how easy it is
- **Social proof request** - asks people to tag friends

## 📘 MAIN FACEBOOK POST (Copy & Paste This)

Hey guitar friends! 👋

I need a small favor. I've been building a guitar learning app called FretPilot Studio, and I'm SO close to launching it on the Google Play Store.

The problem? Google requires 20 people to test the app for 14 days before they'll let me publish it publicly. I'm currently stuck at just a handful of testers.

Here's what I'm asking:

1️⃣ Sign up (takes 30 seconds)
2️⃣ Install the app when you get the invite
3️⃣ Open it a few times over 2 weeks

That's it. You don't have to use it every day or write a review or anything.

🎁 What you get: FREE lifetime premium access ($49.99 value). Not a trial. Not a discount. Lifetime. Forever. As a genuine thank you.

If you play guitar (or know someone who does), I'd really appreciate the help.

👉 Sign up here: https://fretpilotstudio.com/?tester_signup=fretpilot-beta-2025-tester-access-secure-token-xyz789

Feel free to tag any guitar players who might help out! 🎸

Thanks!

## 📘 GUITAR GROUP POST (For Facebook Guitar Groups)

```
[MODS: Delete if not allowed - just an indie dev asking for help!]

Hey everyone! I've been working on an AI-powered guitar learning app called FretPilot Studio. It has practice tools, a metronome, chord library, jam tracks, and lessons.

I'm trying to launch on Google Play but need 20 testers first (Google's rule, not mine 😅). Currently short by about 14 people.

The commitment:
- Install the app
- Use it occasionally for 2 weeks
- That's literally it

The reward:
- FREE lifetime premium access ($49.99 value)
- Keep it forever, no strings attached

If anyone's willing to help out a fellow guitar enthusiast, here's the signup:

Happy to answer any questions! 🎸

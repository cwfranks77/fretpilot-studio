I spent years frustrated with learning guitar.

YouTube tutorials? Random, disorganized, no progression.
Music teachers? Expensive. $50-100/hour.
Other apps? Generic lessons that don't adapt to you.

So I built something different.

FretPilot Studio is an AI-powered music learning app that actually understands where you are and where you want to go.

Here's what makes it different:

🤖 AI LESSONS - Not pre-recorded garbage. The AI creates lessons specifically for your skill level, goals, and music taste. Want to play blues? Jazz? Rock? Metal? The lessons adapt to YOU.

📊 PRACTICE ANALYTICS - Record your sessions, see exactly where you're making mistakes, and get AI-powered suggestions to improve.

🎹 ANY INSTRUMENT - Guitar, piano, bass, ukulele, drums, violin... one app, unlimited instruments.

🎵 JAM COMPANION - Generate backing tracks in any key, tempo, and style. Perfect for practice or songwriting.

⏱️ PRO TOOLS - Metronome, tuner, chord library, scale explorer - all built in.

Over 12,000 musicians are already learning smarter with FretPilot.

Right now, lifetime access is just $49.99 (one payment, forever).

No subscriptions. No hidden fees. Just better music learning.

## 📧 MUSIC FORUM POST (Ultimate Guitar, etc.)

**Title:** Free AI-Powered Guitar Learning App - FretPilot Studio

**Body:**
Hey fellow guitarists!

I wanted to share an app I've been working on called FretPilot Studio. It's designed to be like having a personal guitar teacher available 24/7.

**What it does:**
- AI video lessons tailored to your goals
- 500+ chord library with fingering diagrams
- Practice analyzer that tracks your timing and consistency
- Works for guitar, bass, ukulele, piano, and drums
- Jam companion with backing tracks

**Why I built it:**
Traditional lessons are expensive and inconvenient. YouTube is overwhelming. I wanted something in between - structured learning with the flexibility of an app.

**Try it free:** https://fretpilotstudio.com

Happy to answer any questions. Always looking for feedback from real players!

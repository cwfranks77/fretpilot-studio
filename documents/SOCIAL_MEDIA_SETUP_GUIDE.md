**Title:** (Comment in existing thread, don't create post yet)

**Comment:**
```
Hey r/Guitar! I'm one of the devs behind FretPilot, an app we built to help guitarists see their mistakes visually (like a heatmap).

We got tired of practicing wrong techniques for months before realizing. So we trained an AI to analyze playing in real-time and show exactly where you're off.

Not trying to sell anything here - genuinely curious: what's the biggest frustration you have when practicing? Is it knowing IF you're doing something wrong, or knowing HOW to fix it?

Happy to answer any questions about learning guitar or tech! 🎸

### Good vs. Bad ROI

## 🚫 Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Partner With:
1. **Fake followers:** Check with HypeAuditor or manually (weird usernames, no engagement)
2. **Controversial creators:** Offensive content could harm brand
3. **Inconsistent posters:** Haven't posted in 3+ months
4. **Competitors' partners:** Active partnerships with other guitar apps
5. **Poor production quality:** Blurry videos, bad lighting (reflects poorly on your brand)
6. **Demanding divas:** Unreasonable requests, rude communication

### Warning Signs During Negotiation:
- Asks for full payment upfront (50% upfront is standard)
- Refuses to sign agreement
- Wants to delete content after 30 days (you need longer exposure)
- Doesn't disclose other brand partnerships
- Guarantees specific results (no one can guarantee virality)

---

## 📞 Influencer Communication Best Practices

### Response Times
- Reply to inquiries within 24 hours
- If negotiating, respond within 2-3 hours during business hours
- Set expectations: "We'll send product within 5 business days"

### Tone
- Professional but friendly
- Enthusiastic about their content (genuine compliments)
- Flexible on creative direction
- Clear on requirements (FTC disclosure, timeline)

### What to Provide
- High-res logos (PNG with transparent background)
- Brand guidelines (colors, tone, key messages)
- Product photos (if they can't shoot their own)
- Discount code details
- Talking points (but don't script them - authenticity matters)

### What NOT to Do
- Demand specific language ("You must say it's the best app ever")
- Micromanage creative (they know their audience)
- Get defensive if review is constructive
- Pressure for faster turnaround than agreed
- Disappear after they deliver content (thank them, reshare, stay in touch)

# Test Email Forwarding

## ✅ Your Email Forwarding is Already Set Up!

From Namecheap, you have:
- ✅ Catch-All → cwfranks77@gmail.com
- ✅ info → cwfranks77@gmail.com  
- ✅ support → cwfranks77@gmail.com

## 🧪 How to Test:

### Option 1: Test from Another Email Account
1. Use a different email (friend's, work, etc.)
2. Send email to: `support@fretpilotstudio.com`
3. Subject: "Test Email"
4. Body: "Testing email forwarding"
5. Check your Gmail (cwfranks77@gmail.com) - including SPAM folder

### Option 2: Test from Gmail Itself
1. Go to Gmail → Compose
2. Click "From" dropdown → "Send mail as"
3. Add: `support@fretpilotstudio.com`
4. Send test email to yourself
5. Check your inbox

### Option 3: Use a Free Email Testing Service
- Mail-tester.com
- Send a test email to support@fretpilotstudio.com
- They'll show you if it's being received

## ⏱️ Timing:
- Usually works within **5-10 minutes**
- Can take up to **24 hours** for full DNS propagation

## 🔍 Check Spam Folder:
Gmail might filter forwarded emails. Always check:
- Spam folder
- All Mail folder
- Search: "from:fretpilotstudio.com"

## ❓ Still Not Working?
1. **Wait 24 hours** - DNS propagation can be slow
2. **Check Namecheap** - Make sure forwarding rules show "Active" status
3. **Contact Namecheap Support** - They can verify the forwarding is working on their end

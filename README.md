## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development
```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Start backend API
cd server
node index.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Android
```powershell
# Build web app
npm run build

# Sync to Capacitor
npx cap sync android

# Build APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

APK location: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

---

## Backend Dev Server

Run the minimal Express server (Stripe/dev stubs, analytics, vendor PO):

```powershell
npm run server
```

### Vendor Integration (optional)

To forward dropship purchase orders to a real vendor system, the server supports:

- `SHIPSTATION_API_KEY` and `SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET`: Creates orders via ShipStation API.
- `VENDOR_PO_WEBHOOK_URL`: Posts the order payload to a custom webhook (Zapier/Make/vendor endpoint).

Set the desired variables, then start the server:

```powershell
$env:SHIPSTATION_API_KEY = "<your_key>"; $env:SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET = "<your_secret>"; npm run server
# or
$env:VENDOR_PO_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://your-webhook.example.com"; npm run server
```

When an order is placed (card dev flow or BTC), the app calls `POST /api/vendor/po` with a vendor-summarized payload. The server will:

- Try ShipStation first (if configured) to create an `awaiting_shipment` order.
- Otherwise POST to the configured webhook URL.
- Otherwise log and acknowledge (no-op).

## 💳 Enabling Real Payments & Bank Payouts

### 1. Create / Configure Stripe Account
1. Sign up at https://stripe.com (or log in).
2. Complete the onboarding (business details + identity verification).
3. Add and verify your bank account (Settings → Payouts → External accounts).
4. Switch to "Live" mode after successful test transactions.

### 2. Define Products / Prices (Optional)
For hosted Checkout you can either:
- Use server-side ad‑hoc price_data (current implementation) for physical goods.
- Or create Products + Prices in Stripe Dashboard for subscriptions or recurring items.

### 3. Set Environment Variables (Server)
Use test keys first:
```powershell
$env:STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_xxx"; $env:STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_test_xxx"; npm run server
```
Then live keys once ready:
```powershell
$env:STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_xxx"; $env:STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_live_xxx"; npm run server
```

### 4. Secure Webhook Endpoint
Expose your server over HTTPS (Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.). Set webhook in Stripe Dashboard pointing to `/api/stripe-webhook`. Use the generated signing secret (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).

### 5. Mobile App API Base
During production build:
```powershell
$env:VITE_API_BASE="https://api.yourdomain.com"; npm run build
```
You can override at runtime with `localStorage.setItem('fretpilot-api','https://api.yourdomain.com')` if needed.

### 6. Distinguish Physical vs Digital Requirements
- Physical products (instruments, accessories): Stripe Checkout allowed outside Play Billing.
- Digital subscriptions (Premium/Pro tiers): Google Play policy generally requires Google Play Billing for in‑app purchase of digital goods. Consider migrating subscription flow to Play Billing on Android while keeping Stripe for web.

### 7. Test Flow Before Live
1. Use Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future expiry, any CVC, any US ZIP).
2. Confirm successful test checkout redirects.
3. Verify webhook events (checkout.session.completed).
4. Ensure order creation & vendor PO forwarding are correct.

### 8. Go Live Checklist
- Replace all `sk_test` keys with `sk_live`.
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Ensure HTTPS for API_BASE and privacy policy URL.
- Update Play Store listing payment description (clarify external payments for physical goods only). For digital tiers, implement or plan Play Billing.
- Monitor Stripe Dashboard for first live payouts.

### 9. Payouts
Stripe automatically batches payouts to your bank on a schedule (default ~2 business days after charge in many regions). You can view upcoming payouts in Stripe Dashboard → Balances → Payouts.

### 10. Fraud & Security Essentials
- Never trust client prices (server now uses catalog).
- Consider adding basic rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit) and logging.
- Enable Stripe Radar rules for additional fraud prevention.

### 11. Future Improvements
- Persist orders to a database (Postgres) instead of localStorage.
- Add authenticated user accounts for order history syncing across devices.
- Implement Play Billing for subscription tiers on Android.

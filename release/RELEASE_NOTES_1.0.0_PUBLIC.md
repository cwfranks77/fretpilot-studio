# FretPilot Studio & School – Public Test Release Notes v1.0.0

> “Mastery is deliberate iteration.” FretPilot Studio & School v1.0.0 represents months of focused craftsmanship uniting AI guidance, musical precision, and elegant interface design into a seamless guitar training environment. This public test build reflects a mature, stable foundation ready for broad hands-on exploration.

---
## 1. Vision & Craft
FretPilot Studio & School is engineered to accelerate musical growth by fusing data-driven insight with expressive practice. Every pixel, transition, and algorithm was refined to feel purposeful—zero clutter, maximum clarity. The result: a training studio that responds to the player rather than forcing rigid routines.

---
## 2. Core Feature Pillars
1. AI Lesson Generator – Curates evolving practice sequences from your emerging skill profile.
2. Mistake Heatmap – Precision fretboard visualization of error concentration for targeted refinement.
3. Practice Analyzer – Converts timing, consistency, and clarity into actionable progress intelligence.
4. Jam Companion – Adaptive backing tracks that modulate feel and tempo responsively.
5. Metronome + Tuner Fusion – Unified timing and pitch center for uninterrupted flow.
6. Progress Engine – Tracks mastery velocity, streak continuity, and drill completion quality.
7. Chord Intelligence – Structured chord explorer with inversion fluency and ergonomic fingerings.
8. Premium Gate Framework – Forward-compatible access layer for advanced analytics & extended curricula.
9. Consent-Driven Analytics – User sovereignty first; insight only activates with explicit permission.
10. Extensible Service Layer – Modularity enabling rapid future augmentation (ear training, multiplayer, sync).

---
## 3. Experience Highlights
- Frictionless session launch: open, select intent, begin sculpted progression instantly.
- Data invisibility done right: analytics empower without overwhelming—surfaced only when valuable.
- Fluid visual hierarchy: warm focus states, minimal chromatic noise, high legibility across ambient lighting.
- Latency-conscious audio pipeline: tuner response optimized for natural micro-adjustment feel.

---
## 4. Quality Engineering & Stability
The v1.0.0 public test build has undergone iterative internal validation with emphasis on:
- Smooth permission flows (microphone & network).
- Resilient state persistence (streaks, mastery curves).
- Consistent timing integrity in extended metronome sessions.
- Graceful recovery on app background/foreground transitions.

All critical blockers resolved. No known functional defects impede core training loops.

---
## 5. Privacy & Ethical Design
- No passive audio recording; tuner utilizes transient signal processing only.
- Analytics strictly opt-in; default experience is entirely local.
- No sensitive personal or biometric data collection.
- Clear, revocable consent path; user can reset performance metrics.

---
## 6. Technology Stack & Architecture
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite for rapid, lean builds.
- Cross-Platform Shells: Capacitor (mobile), Electron (desktop), Web (Vercel).
- Modular Services: AI, progress, analytics, consent, feature flagging.
- Extensible Rendering: Components structured for incremental complexity (future multiplayer & ear training overlays).

---
## 7. Forward Roadmap
Short-Term Enhancements:
- Cloud Sync & Profile Portability.
- Advanced Ear Training Modules (interval, chord quality, harmonic prediction).
- Multiplayer Jam Sessions (TURN-enabled latency-aware ensemble).
- Deep Insight Layers (error clustering heat dynamics, phrasing coherence).
- Subscription Tier Launch (premium adaptive curriculum arcs).

Long-Term Vision:
- Context-aware improvisation feedback.
- Cross-instrument expansion (bass, acoustic nuance modeling).
- Social progression comparisons (privacy-preserving aggregates).

---
## 8. Tester Invitation
Public testers are invited to:
- Immerse in daily micro-sessions and evaluate flow continuity.
- Push adaptive tracks with deliberate mistake injection to observe responsiveness.
- Explore chord variations and inversion suggestions across voicing transitions.
- Monitor progression feel—does feedback motivate without pressure?

Feedback Channels (configure as needed):
- In-app feedback panel (upcoming enhancement).
- Designated feedback email / form (add when live).

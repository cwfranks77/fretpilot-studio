### Test Focus Areas

We need your feedback on:

**Critical Paths:**
- [ ] Tuner accuracy (low E string ~82Hz, high E ~330Hz)
- [ ] Metronome stability during long sessions (30+ minutes)
- [ ] Heatmap rendering after rapid practice sequences
- [ ] Jam Companion tempo adaptation (does it slow down appropriately during error clusters?)

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Consent prompt clarity (analytics opt-in flow)
- [ ] Navigation intuitiveness (tab switching, settings access)
- [ ] Practice Analyzer data presentation (is mastery progress clear?)

**Known Issues (Non-Blocking):**
- **KI-001:** Tuner may lag on very low frequencies (<60Hz). Workaround: tune higher strings first.
- **KI-002:** Heatmap may show fret offset after rapid tuning. Close/reopen Mistake Heatmap to refresh.
- **KI-003:** Jam Companion may double-trigger slowdown. Reset tempo manually if this occurs.
